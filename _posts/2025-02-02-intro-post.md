Hi, I'm Shyela. I'm learning various programming with the goal of becoming a web developer. I started learning HTML and CSS fundamentals from the Neopets forum boards when I was very young, but I've learned a lot since then!

In my free time (aside from programming) I enjoy PC gaming and fiber crafts like knitting and crochet :D
